# Forgotten Meadows
### **Description**


Welcome to our project called **Forgotten meadows**,this project is based on designing a 3D scene of a field that has been abandoned for many years. The fundamental tools of this project were **Opengl** for the entire graphic theme integrated with **C++** as the base code and **Cmake** for easy installation of the project.

### **Intallation**

The project is configured with **Cmake** so installing and running it becomes easier.

You only need three tools to install it:
- An IDE like **visual studio code** or **visual studio community** (https://code.visualstudio.com/ or https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/community/)
  
- Install the **c++** and **Cmake** packages for the IDE you are using
  
- Install **git** https://git-scm.com/downloads

To run it you just need to open this downloaded repository in the IDE of your choice and wait for it to be configured automatically thanks to cmake. Once this is ready, you just need to press the run button and that's it!

### **Run Project**

When you run the project you will see a main menu offering some options, to enter directly into the experience just choose the **play** option, but if what you want is to view the scene with another type of lighting and change the camera mode you can choose the second option of menu settings and to finish the execution just choose the **exit** option.
